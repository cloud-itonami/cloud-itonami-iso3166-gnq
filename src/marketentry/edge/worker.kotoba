  "The GNQ market-entry actor's Worker — routes only.

  Everything that is not specific to this actor lives in `marketplace.edge`:
  the kotobase client, the prefetch/run/flush bracket, the ledger ordinal,
  the fail-closed check for a missing seed. Second non-marketplace actor to
  use it, after cloud-itonami-isic-0111.

  ## What is NOT shared, measured rather than assumed

  This is one of 186 `iso3166-*` actors with a byte-identical
  `operation.cljc` and an identical 13-method `Store` protocol, which looks
  like one implementation would serve all of them. It would not. With
  docstrings, comments and string literals stripped, their `store.cljc` files
  still fall into 184 distinct code shapes and their `governor.cljc` into 184
  — each country's checks, thresholds and currency are in the control flow,
  not in a data table. The transport is shared; the actor is not.

  `KotobaseStore` therefore lives in `marketentry.store` rather than here:
  `commit-record!` needs `draft-filing!` and `submit-filing!`, which are
  private to that file.

  ## Approval is deliberately not a route

  The actor compiles with the default in-memory checkpointer, and a Worker
  isolate does not survive to the next request. A resume route would look
  like one and reliably find nothing to resume — an escalation that silently
  never completes is how a governor gets bypassed in practice. A durable
  checkpointer is what makes that route honest."
